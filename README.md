# To play the old games implementation, uncomment the Legacy Games section in app.component.html. This was the first version I built completely on my own, without any AI help.
New game is kinda mix of both old games.
Currently, Iâ€™m working regularly with Claude AI. I provided it with instructions, conducted a code review, and fixed the bugs.
Also I asked Claude to do refactoring, design and animations for the new game.
